# HU Connect – University Knowledge Platform

## Problem Context

Haramaya University students faced a significant knowledge-sharing problem. Academic questions were scattered across Facebook groups, WhatsApp chats, and informal study groups, making it nearly impossible to find answers to previously asked questions. This led to repeated questions, fragmented knowledge, and wasted time.

**Core Problems:**
- **Information Fragmentation:** Knowledge scattered across 20+ Facebook groups
- **Poor Searchability:** No way to search past conversations for answers
- **Quality Control Issues:** Incorrect answers mixed with correct ones, no verification
- **Lack of Recognition:** Helpful students received no acknowledgment for contributions
- **Spam and Noise:** Groups cluttered with off-topic posts and advertisements

## System Architecture

### Stack Overflow-Inspired Design

The platform adapts Stack Overflow's proven Q&A model for university-specific needs:

**Frontend Architecture:**
- React SPA with server-side rendering for SEO
- Real-time updates via WebSocket connections
- Rich text editor with code snippet support
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop

**Backend Services:**
- Node.js/Express REST API
- MongoDB for flexible document storage
- Redis for caching and session management
- Real-time notification service

**Data Models:**
- Questions with tags, votes, and view counts
- Answers with voting and acceptance mechanism
- User profiles with reputation scores
- Moderation queue for flagged content

### Reputation System Design

The reputation system incentivizes quality contributions:

**Earning Reputation:**
- +10 points: Answer accepted by question asker
- +5 points: Answer upvoted
- +2 points: Question upvoted
- -2 points: Answer downvoted
- -1 point: Question downvoted

**Reputation Privileges:**
- 50 points: Comment on any post
- 100 points: Vote down answers
- 500 points: Access moderation tools
- 1000 points: Edit any post
- 2000 points: Delete posts

- Unanswered questions needing attention
- Related questions sidebar

## Engineering Challenges

### Challenge 1: Reputation Algorithm Fairness

**Problem:** Initial reputation system was gamed by users creating multiple accounts to upvote their own content.

**Solution:**
- Implemented vote fraud detection analyzing voting patterns
- Added IP-based duplicate account detection
- Limited voting power for new accounts
- Created reputation decay for inactive users
- Added manual review for suspicious reputation spikes

### Challenge 2: Real-Time Notification Scalability

**Problem:** With 2000+ active users, sending real-time notifications was causing server overload.

**Solution:**
- Implemented WebSocket connection pooling
- Added notification batching (group similar notifications)
- Used Redis pub/sub for efficient message distribution
- Implemented notification priority system
- Added user preference for notification frequency

### Challenge 3: Search Performance

**Problem:** Full-text search across thousands of questions was slow and resource-intensive.

**Solution:**
- Implemented MongoDB text indexes on question/answer content
- Added search result caching for common queries
- Created search query optimization (stemming, stop words)
- Implemented pagination with cursor-based navigation
- Added search analytics to optimize index strategy

### Challenge 4: Content Quality Control

**Problem:** Some answers were incorrect or low-quality, but users couldn't easily identify them.

**Solution:**
- Implemented answer acceptance mechanism (asker marks best answer)
- Added voting system to surface quality content
- Created "low quality" post detection based on length, formatting, votes
- Implemented answer edit suggestions from high-reputation users
- Added answer quality badges (verified, detailed, etc.)

## Outcome & Impact

### Quantitative Results
